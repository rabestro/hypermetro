# HyperMetro

Have you ever been worried about getting lost in the subway? Do you need to find a faster route to your destination?
Write an application that will help you better navigate the complicated metro system.

## About

This project is the implementation of the project [HyperMetro](https://hyperskill.org/projects/120) from JetBrains
Academy. The program loads the metro map (the file with the scheme is specified when the program starts). After loading
the user through the command line interface can execute the following commands:

- add-head line station
- append line station
- remove line station
- connect line1 station1 line2 station2
- output line
- route line1 station1 line2 station2
- fastest-route line1 station1 line2 station2
- shortest-route line1 station1 line2 station2

## Used Technologies

The project is written in Java 17. For parsing JSON file with metro map used library Google Gson. Additionally, I used
Spring Core and Lombock libraries. [The reports](https://rabestro.github.io/jetbrains-academy-hypermetro/) for unit
tests generated by Spock-reports.

## Tests

### Functional Test

The project includes one functional test from JetBrains Academy. This test is used to check the solution and accept the
project.

### Unit Test

In addition to the functional test, I
wrote [unit tests](https://github.com/rabestro/jetbrains-academy-hypermetro-java/tree/master/HyperMetro/task/test/metro)
using Spock Framework 2. [Test reports](https://rabestro.github.io/jetbrains-academy-hypermetro/) are generated by
spock-report.
